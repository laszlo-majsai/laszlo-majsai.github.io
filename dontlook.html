                <h2>The Project</h2>
                <p>This was an other data visualization project of our semester. We had to find a dataset for it, that
                    introduce how invisible technological, social and political changes affect the environment in
                    relation of ecosystems, climate change or AI.</p>
                <p>During our research, we found an interesting dataset, about the global acceptance of human
                    responsibility of climate change. We wanted to work with that, because nowadays the spread of
                    misinformation is getting out of control, and it is important to show how it affects the public
                    opinion in a serios and relevant topic like this.</p>

                <h2>The Database</h2>
                <p>Our source of data was the research of the Ecological Transformation Barometer in 2024. It is a
                    global survey focusing on degree of acceptability made by Veolia - a french transnational
                    companywith activities in water management, waste management and energy services - and Elabe - an
                    independent research and consulting firm structured around consulting, opinion research and
                    strategic planning.
                </p>
                <p>They did the survey with 29 500 people from 26 countries, which were chosen in their weight in
                    demography and greenhouse gas emissions, and they also ensured a diversity of ecological, political
                    and cultural histories.</p>
                <p>The world’s avarage opinion of different questions was calculated by counting each country for 1, so
                    there is no weighting according to the number of inhabitants.</p>

                <h2>The Result</h2>
                <p>As the final concept, we used the stairs of the university as the part of our installation. The
                    amount of the black and the white stairs are showing the ratio of the human-responsibility denial
                    and acceptance on the world’s avarage based on the survey.</p>
                <p> On the black stairs, there are AI generated tweets denying human-responsibility in the language of
                    the countries with the biggest amount of denial, while the accepting ones are on the white stairs.
                </p>
                <p> As you are looking up from the bottom of the stairs you face the reality of our guilt for climate
                    change. The idea of the concept was heavily inspired by the film, “Don’t look up”, which is a
                    satirical comedy that critiques society’s disinterest to existential threats.

                <p>It was also an interesting process to formulate the right promt that makes AI basically generate
                    misinformation. It was an exciting exercise on how to push the boundaries of generative AI.
