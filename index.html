            <h2>INTERACTION DESIGN STUDENT</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Laszlo Majsai and I am currently doing my second semester of Interaction Design MA at
                Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design in Budapest, Hungary.</p>
            <p>In this programme, we are studying all
                the key fundementals of creating digital services, like research, wireframing and prototyping. My
                motivation to become a UX/UI designer is to be able to keep people connected with the constantly
                developing technology. Welcome to my portfolio website!</p>

                <h2>Product design Excercise</h2>
                <p>For this assignment we were given a phenomena of nature which inspires us to design some kind of
                    display. Mine was
                    water. At first we had to make sketches and start looking for different shapes that can be
                    developed to a concept of a product. Then we had to make 5 rough design based on
                    those sketches. We had to develop one of those to a finished concept.
                    I ended up with this raindrop inspired minimalistic display,
                    which can be hanged in a living room and put some plants,
                    photos or other decorative items in it.</p>

                <h2>Interactive Map</h2>
                <p>This was the main project during my Erasmus semester in the Netherlands. I was in a group of
                    three, and our project was to design a tool or a system for the university’s new building, which
                    gathering, storing and displaying sensor
                    data. The building was made as a hybrid learning environment, where students are working on
                    projects together using innovative technologies.</p>

                <p>This project was made for a one week long course at my university. In this programme, we studied
                    the latest and most experimental methods of data visualization. At the end of the week, we had
                    to present our own concept. We were allowed to use any source of data, and any form of
                    visualization.</p>

                <h2>Smoke Quitting App</h2>
                <p>This concept is made for a course called “Designing positive technology tools”. The goal of the
                    class was to choose a mental health issue and design an app or any digital platform, that can
                    help people deal with it. We have chosen addiction. After several brainstormings, we decided to
                    create an app that helps people quit smoking. It is a concept, that has many already implemented
                    examples for, but we made our own approach to it, that differs from other similar items on the
                    market.</p>

                <p>This was our biggest project during last semester. We were given four issues, that are common in
                    the rural area of Hungary, and we had to make a concept of a digital tool, that can help solving
                    it. I chose misinformation for my intervention area. I started to investigate, how I, as a
                    designer can help to improve access to reliable information in rural communities to combat fake
                    and biased news sources and strengthen civic participation.</p>
