                <h2>The Project</h2>
                <p>The class that this project was made for was an introduction to creative coding and computer vision
                    using modern web based technologies. By the development of machine learning and deep neural
                    networks, our machines now understand drawings, objects, human poses, gestures, and many other
                    semantically meaningful components, that are related to vision.</p>
                <p>During the course, we were experimenting with some basic methods on how to use these advances. The
                    technology that we got to know and then used for our project is augmented reality and image
                    tracking. We wanted to design something, that uses the facilities of our environment to show people
                    the opportunities of this digital space.</p>

                <h2>The Concept</h2>
                <p>Our idea was to give an opportunity for street artist to express themselves and share their work with
                    people, but without vandalizing the buildings, so we decided to design an AR based app, where they
                    can project the digitalized version of their art on buildings. Therefore, we could also provide a
                    new creative space for artists, where they could fulfill their potential and reach more people to
                    showcase their work.</p>

                <h3>Artworks</h3>
                <p>To demonstrate the collaborative aspect of our concept, and also have something special for the
                    showcase
                    of our project, we asked some of the students in the campus to create the artworks for our
                    application.
                    As Moholy-Nagy is a well-respected art and design university, it wasn't a challange to fing some
                    talented students, who helped us with their amazing graphical artworks.</p>

                <h3>Markers</h3>
                <p>To integrate augmented reality into our application, we had to create markers. Markers are real
                    objects
                    that our camera recognizes and uses as a digital layer. We looked for objects that consist of simple
                    elements but are difficult to confuse. That's why we decided to use street signs in Budapest. We
                    photographed signs displaying street names and house numbers, retouched them to make them
                    high-contrast
                    and correct perspective errors, and then uploaded them to MindAR to create markers from them. We
                    integrated these markers into our code. We created a GitHub page for this project, which can be
                    opened
                    from the Figma prototype, so the concept actually works with real-life street signs.</p>
